# TheHobbitNLP

The goal of this project is to utilize Natural Language Processing methods to analyze the *The Hobbit*, by J.R.R. Tolkein.

Current aims include:
* Identify characteristics of the writing (# of unique words, # of most frequent words, average sentence length, etc).
* Characterize the interactions between the main character and key supporting characters.
* Track sentiment analysis of characters over the length of the novel.
* Form a conclusion based on quantitative evidence.

## Code

Because I am a novice programmer, I plan to use the basic Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK) packages for python in this project. In the future, I hope to expand my skillset to other models: TextBlob, spaCy, Vader. I also plan to use pandas & matplotlib to organize and visualize data.
